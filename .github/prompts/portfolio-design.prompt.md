Your task is to build a portfolio webpage for a software engineer. Look at the provided profile data in the `profile.ts` file to gather all necessary information about the engineer's background, skills, experience, and projects. Design a webpage that looks like `sample.png`.

**DO**
- Use the provided profile data in `profile.ts` file.
- Create a clean and modern design.
- Ensure the webpage is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Highlight key sections such as About Me, Skills, Experience, Projects, and Contact Information.
- Use appropriate colors, fonts, and layouts to enhance readability and visual appeal.
- Include interactive elements like hover effects on project cards and smooth scrolling for navigation links.
- Optimize images and assets for fast loading times.
- Ensure accessibility standards are met (e.g., alt text for images, proper heading structure).
- dark mode by default, with a toggle for light mode.

**DO NOT**
- Include any personal opinions or additional content not present in the `profile.ts` file.
- Use overly complex designs that may detract from the content.
- Add any sections or features that are not relevant to a software engineer's portfolio.
- Use deprecated HTML or CSS practices.
- Include any references to the prompt or instructions in the final design.

**Requirement**
- Move profile.ts and interface.ts to the appropiate directories in the project structure.
- Ensure all links and contact information are functional.
